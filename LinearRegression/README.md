PS: Make an ML model to help him plot a graph given force and acceleration in coordinates and thus find the best fit for the mass.

TO RUN: open in LinearRegression directory

python main.py

TO Generate CSV file:

python testFileGen.py

Using LinearRegression mass of a object is estimated

testFileGen.py can genrate a csv file filled with force and accerlation data with some random error.

Score(sort of a error in mass estimate) and mass estimated are printed in main
